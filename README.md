# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
- we created this project for my college submission, I've a 3 more member in my team.
- In this project we created a platform which predicts the possibility of credit card approval using Machine Learning models, which predicts 90% accuracy.
- We built a machine learning-based classifier that predicts if a credit card application will get approved or not, based on the information provided in the application.
- While building this credit card approval predictor, we learned about common preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, label encoding, and handling missing values.
- We implemented five different machine learning models, optimized the hyperparameters, and evaluated the performance using the accuracy score and comparing the performance between train and test data.
- We have used pythonâ€™s machine learning libraries to implement machine learning algorithms.
